# AFK BOT Crossfire

> Now we will learn how to install and use the AFK Bot for Crossfire. I will also leave the parameters used for faster farming.

!!! tip
This is mainly used for EXP/Badge/Event farming.  
 It prevents the bots from idling and ensures they're pressing ready after every match and clossing dialogs.

## Configure Crossfire Settings

Before we start we will have to configure our Crossfire in window mode.
