Note Although the program brings a K3yG3n we are not going to explain how to use it. Use MacroRecorder \u00b6 Tip With this Program you can save configurations so as not to be repeating each time you go to spend it. With the AutoKey Bot no. To start you will have to run the program as Administrator. Once the program is open, we can record and create our custom macro or copy the one in the following image. The macro of the image enters directly into the game by clicking on the ready / join button.

Name the virtual machine and then enter the size. Note 60 GB is the recomended. Crossfire takes at least +10GB Now we press next and it will start with the creation of the virtual machine Note Personally I leave the ram in 2GB. but you can increase or decrease it as you see necessary. Tip Consider switching the Network Adapter to use a Bridget connection instead of NAT. This avoids getting Network Connection Errors in CrossFire as each client gets its own IP-Address.

Info If you want to copy CrossFire from your Host System make sure to do this before adjusting the configuration. It seems like adjusting the configuration will break drag-and-drop feature. Tip To send files, use the WINDOWS shared folders, not VMWARE, or simply send the files before doing this process. We close the virtual machine and right click on it and open its directory. In the following folder we will have to locate a file with the extension .vmx and open it with any text editor.
